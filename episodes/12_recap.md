Congratulations!
You have completed all parts of this Julia course and built a solid foundation for working with Julia.

By completing these lessons, you not only gained practical skills in Julia but also learned key principles of scientific programming: structuring code, reusability, readability, and testing.

## What’s Next?

- Apply Julia to your own projects and research questions.
- Connect with the Julia community: [https://julialang.org/community/](https://julialang.org/community/).
- Continue your learning with more advanced courses on topics like machine learning in Julia, scientific computing, optimization, or high-performance numerical simulations.

## Final Thought

Learning to program means: practice, experimentation, and curiosity.
With the foundations you have gained here, you are well prepared to use Julia for your own data analysis and scientific projects.

Good luck on your Julia journey
