This course is designed for scientists with no programming experience as well as for programmers experienced in other languages. It helps learners transition from wet lab work to data analysis or apply existing programming skills to Julia. Participants will learn to import, manipulate, and visualize data, understand Julia’s syntax and data structures, and develop reproducible workflows for scientific computing. The course provides a gentle introduction for beginners while enabling experienced programmers to adapt their knowledge to Julia’s environment.
